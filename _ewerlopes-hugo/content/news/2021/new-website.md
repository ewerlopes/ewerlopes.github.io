Hi again. I realize much time has passed since my last update in this website. Many things have indeed changed since 2017 such that no priority could have been allocated to it before.The truth is that I am back and will continue, now with renewed strength, the objective of my first post: to write about technical stuff in (probabilistic) machine learning, statistics & probability, graphical models and, most frequently, about causal inference.

Part of my comeback is due to my role as co-supervisor for some post-grad students. I intend to deposit here some resources to help them in their research work.

In general, the main goal here is to provide a portifolio of topics/projects I am interested in and demonstrate much easily the spectrum of my research and technical skills. Stay tuned!

Thank you.
