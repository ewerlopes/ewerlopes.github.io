Welcome to my personal website. &para; I work as Data Science,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank" >ML</a> engineer
and researcher at <a href="https://www.hp.com" target="_blank">HP Inc</a>. Yep! You read it right I indeed wear many hats! From 2021, I started
co-advising students in the <a href="https://laser.ci.ufpb.br/en/" target="_blank">Laboratory of Systems Engineering and Robotics</a>
at the <a href="https://www.ufpb.br/" target="_blank">UFPB</a> and at <a href="http://www.senaicimatec.com.br/en/" target="_blank">SENAI-CIMATEC</a>. &para; Nothing

universities I collaborate with.</p>

# üéØ My Interests

I have a deep interest in the probabilistic perpective to machine learning and artificial intelligence, especially  in the identification of causal mechanisms via statistical quantities from data (aka Causal Inference). Other topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

- Learning Theory (bandits, game theory, statistical learning theory, etc.)
- Optimization (convex and non-convex optimization, matrix/tensor methods, sparsity, etc.)
- Probabilistic Inference (Bayesian methods, graphical models, Monte Carlo methods, etc.)
- Trustworthy Machine Learning (accountability, causality, fairness, privacy, robustness, etc.)

# ‚öñÔ∏è My Core Scientific Values

- üß™ Theory: data is not everything. The Data Mechanism is an important part of modeling.
- üîì Openness: science is best when people can build on each others' work. Sharing data, code, and ideas has benefitted everyone, and is also the responsibility of a scientist to pay forward.
- üéØ Thoroughness: quality is dependent on taking great care throughout all steps.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Reproducibility: code is part of the scientific process. It should be documented and re-usable by anyone.

# ü•á Bio

I received the Bachelor and M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Para√≠ba (Brazil), in 2013 and 2015 respectively. I collected my Ph.D from the [Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering](https://www.deib.polimi.it/eng/home-page) at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/) (Italy) in 2019, where during [my research](https://github.com/ewerlopes/phd_robogame) I concentrated efforts on the design of smarter Physically Interactive Robot Games through the application of Artificial Intelligence and Probabilistic Machine Learning methods to support high quality Human-Robot interaction during play.
