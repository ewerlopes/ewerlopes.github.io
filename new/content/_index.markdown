# De causa computatrorum!

Hi there! I am a <em>computer scientist</em> who likes typing about artificial intelligence, computing, statistics and, of course, ancient languages (Latin and Greek). &para; Be aware that “for a long time I’ve resisted making a blog about anything technical because, to be frank, I didn’t feel like I was qualified. What makes me more qualified now? Nothing really, I’m just <em>a bit less afraid of being wrong</em>".
