We propose a quantitative human player model for <em>Physically Interactive RoboGames</em> that can account for the combination of the player activity (physical effort) and interaction level. The model is based on activity recognition and a description of the player interaction (proximity and body contraction index) with the robot co-player. Our approach has been tested on a dataset collected from a real, physical robot game, where activity patterns extracted by a custom 3-axis accelerometer sensor module and by the Microsoft Kinect sensor are used. The proposed model design aims at inspiring approaches that can consider the activity of a human player in lively games against robots and foster the design of robotic adaptive behavior capable of supporting her/his engagement in such type of games.
