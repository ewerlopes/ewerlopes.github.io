    Hi, my name is Luis Moneda, I'm a data scientist with a background in computer engineering and economics.

    I work as a Data Science Manager at <a href="https://www.nubank.com.br">Nubank</a>.

    I'm interested in machine learning, causal inference, and emacs. I hope I can write about these subjects here!

        I received the Bachelor and M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Paraíba (Brazil), in 2013 and 2015 respectively. I collected my Ph.D from the [Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering](https://www.deib.polimi.it/eng/home-page) at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/) (Italy) in 2019, where during [my research](https://github.com/ewerlopes/phd_robogame) I concentrated efforts on the design of smarter Physically Interactive Robot Games through the application of Artificial Intelligence and Probabilistic Machine Learning methods to support high quality Human-Robot interaction during play.
