Salve! Haec de causa computratorum est! &para; I am a **computer scientist** with a passion for ancient languages (Latin and Greek). &para; For a long time I've resisted making a blog about anything technical [or otherwise] because, to be frank, I didn't feel like I was qualified. What makes me more qualified now? Nothing really, I'm just **a bit less afraid of [being wrong](https://xkcd.com/386/)**. **Opinions expressed here are my own and do not reflect those of my employer**.
