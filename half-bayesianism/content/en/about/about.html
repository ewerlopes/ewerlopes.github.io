    Hi there! I am Ewerton and I received the Bachelor and M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the Federal University
    of Paraíba (Brazil), in 2013 and 2015 respectively. ¶ I collected my Ph.D from the <a href="https://www.deib.polimi.it/eng/home-page">Department of Electronics,
    Information and Bioengineering</a> at <a href="https://www.polimi.it/en/">Politecnico di
    Milano</a> (Italy) in 2019, where during <a href="https://github.com/ewerlopes/phd_robogame">my
    research</a> I concentrated efforts on the design of smarter Physically
    Interactive Robot Games through the application of Artificial Intelligence and Probabilistic Machine Learning
    methods to support high quality Human-Robot interaction during play.
