Hi there! If you got here, assume you want to know more about me. &para; I am Ewerton and I received the Bachelor and M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Paraíba (Brazil), in 2013 and 2015 respectively. &para; I collected my Ph.D from the <a href="https://www.deib.polimi.it/eng/home-page">Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering</a> at <a href="https://www.polimi.it/en/">Politecnico di Milano</a> (Italy) in 2019, where during <a href="https://github.com/ewerlopes/phd_robogame">my research</a> I concentrated efforts on the design of smarter Physically Interactive Robot Games through the application of Artificial Intelligence and Probabilistic Machine Learning methods to support high quality Human-Robot interaction during play.
