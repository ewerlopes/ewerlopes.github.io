<description>&lt;p class=textornament&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://ewerlopes.github.io/ornaments/orn1.svg&#34; width=256 height=100/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;newthought&#34;&gt;If you are reading this post&lt;/span&gt;, you are probably a researcher like me (or someone who happens to like reading about science); Better, you must be one of my students!
&lt;p&gt;Fact is: research is a complex process. When done right, it is just art; when done poorly, it may have far-reaching consequences across multiple dimensions; it can bring one to a hideous spiral of psychological issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right! Let&amp;rsquo;s get down to business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have heard people talk about the importance of time management. Rarely this subject, like proper civil education, is discussed with greater detail or practice during formal training. I, for example, never had any &amp;ldquo;formal instruction&amp;rdquo; at the university on how to organize my time around work, let alone research. It took me ages to realize that the key not just to success, but also for a happier life, was not just time management, but also &amp;ldquo;focus management&amp;rdquo;. I learnt that &lt;em&gt;it is to no avail to concentrate on time management without a proper understanding of what has to be managed using time&lt;/em&gt;. There is no amount of pomodoro&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;Perhaps you have already found out about the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pomodoro technique&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; (🍅) capable to change this fact of nature!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s my humble suggestion for the intelligent reader who doesn&amp;rsquo;t wish to fall prey to the hardships that clumsy research can impose: use &lt;em&gt;Agile&lt;/em&gt;! That is it; you&amp;rsquo;ve read it right: agile, the project development methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s expose the truth: research is traditionally done in a waterfall approach where results are expected to be known only at the end of a chain of tasks. Chances are that you&amp;rsquo;ve used this method your whole academic life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura Pirro wrote, a couple of years ago, a nice &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01184-9&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; for the career column on nature on how agile can transform the way we do research. She describes how the methodology can be used to improve results, collaboration and learning. All this, of course, is accompanied by improvements in the &amp;ldquo;happiness&amp;rdquo; of all research members involved -  students and professors alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She recalls us that &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;In an agile project-management plan, an early, partial result, which can be improved on at a later stage, matters more than a perfect result reached only at the end of the project.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This is particularly valid in a research context, where initial results are useful to validate your bearing. Believe me when I say that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t find it fun to discover that you have been tricked by the false hopes of a perfect result; the familiar waterfall approach will for sure let you down when you realize you need to change your original proposal (after all, research proposal do change, don&amp;rsquo;t they?!). Achieving results in a waterfall approach are as risky as investing in the Brazilian stock market during global pandemics. So, how do you use Agile for research then? Let&amp;rsquo;s see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An agile experimental protocol&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-2&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-2&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;It really doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if it is a PhD or a Master&amp;rsquo;s project.&lt;/span&gt; would involve defining a dedicated, limited, period of work (for example, 2–12 weeks), called a &lt;em&gt;sprint&lt;/em&gt;, to work on a set of agreed-upon activities (a.k.a. tasks). Here are the steps of this protocol:&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-3&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-3&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;from Laura&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01184-9&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Splitting the work&lt;/strong&gt;. Split up your work into several activities. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about the number of such activities&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-4&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-4&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;Divide and conquer to the rescue!&lt;/span&gt;. Just focus on &lt;em&gt;defining &lt;strong&gt;atomic tasks&lt;/strong&gt; (no task should have more than a reasonable number of objectives with clear acceptance criteria), each of which is characterized by a tangible result to be obtained&lt;/em&gt;. You can look upon the web how to properly execute this step of an agile framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprint planning&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Meet your supervisor and any other stakeholders (for example, a postdoc, co-supervisors, industrial partner, etc.) in a short meeting (around 30 minutes) to define the goal of your sprint (for example, [which tasks - experiments - to do]) and its duration (four weeks, for instance). Everybody has to agree on these two points - goal and time -  so that expectations are aligned. On this occasion, the &lt;em&gt;sprint-review meeting&lt;/em&gt; (see step 5) can be scheduled.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprint execution&lt;/strong&gt;. Time to work. Here&amp;rsquo;s where you should put your maximum effort to produce the planned goals&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-5&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-5&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;You can eat as many pomodori (🍅) as you wish if it helps you to get the job done!&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly scrum&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Meet your supervisor [and any other stakeholders] [&amp;hellip;], but ideally every week. This meeting has to be short and efficient [&amp;hellip;]. Only three questions need to be addressed: what was done the previous week to contribute to the goal? (For example, which experiments were performed?) What will be done next week to contribute to the goal? (For example, what experiments will be performed next?) And, are there any impediments? (For example, is the set-up working properly? Are all the materials needed available?)&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprint review, retrospective and planning&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;At the end of the sprint, meet all of the stakeholders to discuss results and whether those are in line with expectations (review). Take some time to go into detail and do some analytical brainstorming together. Discuss the difficulties encountered, so that the next sprint is better than the previous one (retrospective). This is the phase for ‘impediment removal’, or problem-solving. Honesty and transparency are crucial. Agile is all about adapting to change: plans can change. Go back to step one and restart the planning, addressing the next layer of work in a new Sprint&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is: there is no magic formula for perfect research. But, there are tangible ones towards improving your chances of conducting excellent research&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-6&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-6&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;within what the word &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; stands for.&lt;/span&gt;, while actually having fun (and tranquillity, and consequently happiness) during the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi again. I realize much time has passed since my last update in this website. Many things have indeed changed since 2017 such that no priority could have been allocated to it before. The truth is that I am back and will continue, now with renewed strength, the objective of my first post: to write about technical stuff in (probabilistic) machine learning, statistics &amp;amp; probability, graphical models and, most frequently, about causal inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of my comeback is due to my role as co-supervisor for some post-grad students. I intend to deposit here some resources to help them in their research work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the main goal here is to provide a portifolio of topics/projects I am interested in and demonstrate much easily the spectrum of my research and technical skills. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Learning and Mining Player Motion Profiles in Physically Interactive Robogames</title>
<link>https://ewerlopes.github.io/writing/learning-mining-in-robogames/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2018 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>https://ewerlopes.github.io/writing/learning-mining-in-robogames/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physically-Interactive RoboGames&lt;/em&gt; (PIRG) are an emerging application whose aim is to develop robotic agents able to interact and engage humans in a game situation. In this framework, learning a model of players&#39; activity is relevant both to understand their engagement, as well as to understand specific strategies they adopted, which in turn can foster game adaptation. Following such directions and given the lack of quantitative methods for player modeling in PIRG, we propose a methodology for representing players as a mixture of existing player&amp;rsquo;s types uncovered from data. This is done by dealing both with the intrinsic uncertainty associated with the setting and with the agent necessity to act in real time to support the game interaction. Our methodology first focuses on encoding time series data generated from player-robot interaction into images, in particular &lt;em&gt;Gramian angular field images&lt;/em&gt;, to represent continuous data. To these, we apply latent Dirichlet allocation to summarize the player&amp;rsquo;s motion style as a probabilistic mixture of different styles discovered from data. This approach has been tested in a dataset collected from a real, physical robot game, where activity patterns are extracted by using a custom three-axis accelerometer sensor module. The obtained results suggest that the proposed system is able to provide a robust description for the player interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I&#39;ve started my personal site</title>
<link>https://ewerlopes.github.io/news/2017/start/</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there! I would like to announce I will be writing technical posts on this
website. Most of the design you see here is taken from the gorgeous &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently. org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;consequently.org&lt;/a&gt; managed by &lt;em&gt;Greg Restall&lt;/em&gt;, from who some years ago I took
the course series &lt;em&gt;Logic: language and information&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://coursera.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt; and absolutely fell in love with his sensitivity in choosing beautiful fonts for the lecture
notes. On his website, that same sensibility is kept, which is seen through
the amazing choice of calligraphy set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I plan to write about &lt;em&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/em&gt; (ML) subjects I am currently
studying, including: &lt;em&gt;Variational Inference&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bayesian Optimization&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gaussian
Processes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Deep Learning&lt;/em&gt;… In summary, anything related, but not limited to, ML…
I will basically focus on probabilistic views and try to give a comprehensible
explanation together with code Jupyter notebook style) and dummy-man math (i.e., I&amp;rsquo;ll try to use a &amp;ldquo;for dummy&amp;rdquo; style when explaining things).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main objective is to use the site as a repository where to deposit my
knowledge and be able to revisit when needed (since I keep forgetting things, :D).
On the process I hope this is also going to be useful for someone else starting
to learn these subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randomly, I will aso write about my hoobies: artistic calligraphy, ancient
languages study (mainly Ancient Greek and Latin), as well as electronics&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before closing this short first post, I would like to quote &lt;a href=&#34;http://bjlkeng.github.io/posts/a-first-post/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Brian Keng&lt;/a&gt;
(you must definitely check out his &lt;a href=&#34;http://bjlkeng.github.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; and note the similarities with mine!) by saying that
&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;For a long time I&amp;rsquo;ve resisted making a blog about anything technical because,
to be frank, I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I was qualified. What makes me more qualified now?
Nothing really, I&amp;rsquo;m just a bit less afraid of &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/386/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;being wrong&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, feel free to interact using the comment board as well as sending me e-mails
or twitter messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Modeling Player Activity in a Physical Interactive Robot Game Scenario</title>
<link>https://ewerlopes.github.io/writing/modeling-player-activity-robogames/</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2017 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>https://ewerlopes.github.io/writing/modeling-player-activity-robogames/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a quantitative human player model for &lt;em&gt;Physically Interactive RoboGames&lt;/em&gt; that can account for the combination of the player activity (physical effort) and interaction level. The model is based on activity recognition and a description of the player interaction (proximity and body contraction index) with the robot co-player. Our approach has been tested on a dataset collected from a real, physical robot game, where activity patterns extracted by a custom 3-axis accelerometer sensor module and by the Microsoft Kinect sensor are used. The proposed model design aims at inspiring approaches that can consider the activity of a human player in lively games against robots and foster the design of robotic adaptive behavior capable of supporting her/his engagement in such type of games.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Activity recognition in a Physical Interactive RoboGame</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we investigate the possibility of human physical activity recognition in a robot game scenario. Being able to recognize types of activity is essential to enable robot behavior adaptation to support player engagement. Also, the introduction of this recognition system will allow for development of better models for prediction, planning and problem solving in PIRGs that can foster human-robot interaction. The experiments reported on this paper were performed on data collected from real in-game activity, where a human player faces a mobile robot. We use a custom single tri-axial accelerometer module attached to the player’s chest in order to capture motion information. The main characteristic of our approach is the extraction of features from patterns found on the motion variance rather than on raw data. Furthermore, we allow for the recognition of unconstrained motion given that we do not ask the players to perform target activities before hand: all detectable activities are derived from the free player motion during the game itself. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to consider activity recognition in a physical interactive robogame.&lt;/p&gt;
