      <description>&lt;p&gt;When doing Bayesian Inference, or any other type of inference,&#xA;chances are you have heard about &lt;strong&gt;KL divergence&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; short for &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence&#34;&gt;Kullback-Leibler divergence&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;This quantity has been pervasive in machine learning and artificial intelligence and in this post I would like to explore with you, the reader, some reasons for why this is so, especially for probabilistic inference. Eventually, we&amp;rsquo;ll find ourselves dealing with Variational Inference and with a little more patience, with Expectation Propagation. But first, let&amp;rsquo;s start as usual: with a definition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this post, you are probably a researcher like me (or someone who happens to like reading about science); Better, you must be one of my students!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fact is: research is a complex process. When done right, it is just art; when done poorly, it may have far-reaching consequences across multiple dimensions; it can bring one to a hideous spiral of psychological issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right! Let&amp;rsquo;s get down to business.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there! I would like to announce I will be writing technical posts on this&#xA;website. Most of the design you see here is taken from the gorgeous &lt;a href=&#34;https://consequently.org&#34;&gt;consequently.org&lt;/a&gt; managed by &lt;em&gt;Greg Restall&lt;/em&gt;, from whom some years ago I took&#xA;the course series &lt;em&gt;Logic: language and information&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org&#34;&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt; and absolutely fell in love with his sensitivity in choosing beautiful fonts for the lecture&#xA;notes. On his website, that same sensibility is kept, which is seen through&#xA;the amazing choice of calligraphy set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
