      <description>ðŸŽ¯ My Interests I have a deep interest in the probabilistic perspective to machine learning and artificial intelligence, especially in the identification of causal mechanisms via statistical quantities from data (aka Causal Inference). Other topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
 Learning Theory (bandits, game theory, statistical learning theory, etc.) Optimization (convex and non-convex optimization, matrix/tensor methods, sparsity, etc.) Probabilistic Inference (Bayesian methods, graphical models, Monte Carlo methods, etc.</description>
