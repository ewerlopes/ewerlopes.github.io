      <description>When doing Bayesian Inference, or any other type of inference, chances are you have heard about KL divergence &amp;ndash; short for Kullback-Leibler divergence. This quantity has been pervasive in machine learning and artificial intelligence and in this post I would like to explore with you, the reader, some reasons for why this is so, especially for probabilistic inference. Eventually, we&amp;rsquo;ll find ourselves dealing with Variational Inference and with a little more patience, with Expectation Propagation.</description>
